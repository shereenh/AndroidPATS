# AndroidParkingAuthorityTicketingSystem

- Managed a team of four developers to build a native android application for immediate use by PATS (Parking Authority Ticketing System) of New Jersey.
- Application developed using Google’s Location, Maps and Autocomplete APIs with extensive Recycler Views managed under both Linear and Relative Layouts using a SQLite database to store the application data.
- I was responsible for allocating and overseeing the completion of tasks to my team as well as contributing up to 50% of the total development workload as well as revising and testing 100% of the code.
- We were able to satisfy 100% of our client’s requirements. We went further and also implemented a machine learning algorithm to generate the shortest path at our client’s request.
- My team won first place at the NJIT Fall Capstone 2017!
